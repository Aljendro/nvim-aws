# NVIM-AWS Plugin

## Features

- Autogenerated thin-wrappers around most AWS CLI services (CloudWatch, DynamoDB, EC2, Lambda, Logs, S3, SNS, SQS, …).
- Pre-packaged interactive “workflows” for the most common tasks:
  - CloudWatch Logs: browse groups/streams, live-tail, apply filters, open AWS-Console link.
  - DynamoDB: quick table scan/get-item helpers.
  - S3: bucket/object browser and object viewer.
- Lua utilities that make it trivial to execute any AWS command from Neovim and capture the structured JSON response.
- Batteries-included test-suite (Busted) and helper scripts for localstack-based testing.

## Installation

Using lazy.nvim:

```lua
{
  "your-name/nvim-aws",
  dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" },
  config = function()
    require("nvim-aws").setup()
  end,
}
```

## Configuration

(The plugin works out-of-the-box with the AWS environment variables in your shell.  
The block below shows the optional explicit setup call.)

```lua
require('nvim-aws').setup({
  aws = {
    aws_endpoint_url = 'http://localhost:4566', -- e.g. localstack
    region           = 'us-east-1',
    profile          = 'default',
  },
})
```

## Quick start

`:AWSLogs` – start CloudWatch Logs workflow  
`:AWSDynamoDB` – open DynamoDB workflow  
`:AWSS3` – open S3 workflow

Run `:help nvim-aws` for the complete command list.

## Contributing

Pull requests and issues are welcome.  
Run `make test` (requires docker & localstack) before opening a PR.

_NOTE_: Plugin is a WIP, nothing useful can be done with it yet.

Nvim plugin created to interact with aws services.
