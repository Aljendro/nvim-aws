# Default Workflow

This workflow is designed to be a light wrapper around the aws cli.

Essentially, allows for searching the service and command to run,
then executing the command with some input.

- TODO: (default_workflow_docs)
  - add additional details on how commands are run
  - how services are generated
  - how cli is configured
